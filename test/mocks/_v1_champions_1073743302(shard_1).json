  "description": "The son of a lighthouse keeper, and the Atlantean Queen, Arthur Curry initially enjoyed a quiet, peaceful life with his father on the surface. This all changed when the media learned of the existence of an 'Aquaman' from Atlantis. Their reports drew the attention of Black Manta, a treasure hunter whose obsession with Atlantean treasures led to the death of Arthur's father. Escaping the surface world, Arthur took his rightful place as King of Atlantis. After a few years, Arthur tired of the court's intrigues and returned to the surface with his love, Mera. He now guards the ocean shores, protecting both worlds but feeling at home in neither.<br><br>Aquaman is extremely strong and is quite resilient in combat. He wields the Trident of the Atlantean King to great effect, he can breathe underwater, and can communicate telepathically with most forms of aquatic life.",
