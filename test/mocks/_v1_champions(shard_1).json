        "description": "The son of a lighthouse keeper, and the Atlantean Queen, Arthur Curry initially enjoyed a quiet, peaceful life with his father on the surface. This all changed when the media learned of the existence of an 'Aquaman' from Atlantis. Their reports drew the attention of Black Manta, a treasure hunter whose obsession with Atlantean treasures led to the death of Arthur's father. Escaping the surface world, Arthur took his rightful place as King of Atlantis. After a few years, Arthur tired of the court's intrigues and returned to the surface with his love, Mera. He now guards the ocean shores, protecting both worlds but feeling at home in neither.<br><br>Aquaman is extremely strong and is quite resilient in combat. He wields the Trident of the Atlantean King to great effect, he can breathe underwater, and can communicate telepathically with most forms of aquatic life.",

The Joker welcomed them with a cackle and told them it was time to build the future.<br><br>The Joker told them that the military had wanted to use his “unique mind” to come up with nuclear war scenarios. Displaying a brutal pragmatism that the Joker appreciated, they put his head in a preservation vessel and got rid of the “superfluous parts.” Now that the “serious” world was dead and gone, he told the survivors, it was time to build a new “crazy” one. So desperate were the survivors that they decided to listen to the Joker and began building a new community within the bunker.<br><br>As the community prospered, the survivors increasingly followed the Joker’s orders without question, until they eventually had no will of their own. When the Joker commanded that his vessel be attached to the back of one of his minions, so that he could better see the world he was building, many vied for the honor.<br><br>The gruesome combat that took place left but one survivor: a scarred, voiceless brute who the Joker named “Gaggy.” From his spot perched on Gaggy’s back, the Joker now rides through the nuclear wasteland, always looking to expand the borders of Jokertown.<br><br>The Joker of Earth-17 is the ultimate combination of brains and brawn.

This flaw led to the Manhunters slaughtering an entire sector of space before they were shutdown. Of trillions of inhabitants, only Atrocitus and four other creatures survived this massacre. These survivors formed a terrorist cabal called the 'Five Inversions'. The Inversions went on to wage war against the Guardians, but were ultimately defeated and imprisoned. Imprisonment, though, did not quench Atrocitus' rage. Eventually gaining his freedom, he butchered his fellow Inversions and used their blood and his rage to fashion the first Red Power Ring. So armed, his war on the Guardians began anew.<br><br>Unlike other Power Rings, those who wear a Red Power Ring are typically unable to create constructs. Instead, they are able to summon forth and expel from their mouth a red-colored plasma that adheres to its target.

Those touched by the phantoms faded from reality, and became phantoms themselves. Desperate to halt the invasion, and needing protection from the phantoms' touch, Superman retrieved an 'ecto-suit' built by his father Jor-El, and flew into one of the portals.<br><br>Within the Phantom Zone Superman battled Aethyr, a being unknowable and incomprehensible. Those who looked upon it were driven mad. Aethyr had slumbered within the depths of the Zone for millennia, but the arrival of hundreds of Kryptonian prisoners had slowly awakened it. Enraged, Aethyr enslaved the prisoners' minds, and drove them to seek those responsible for disturbing it: The House of El. As Superman and Aethyr battled, Aethyr weakened and eventually retreated to his eon-long slumber to heal. As it retreated back into the Phantom Zone's depths, the portals it had created winked out of existence. The world saved from the phantom invasion, Superman barely escaped through one of the portals.<br><br>Superman's victory, however, was a hollow one. While he had battled Aehtyr, every living soul in Metropolis had been transformed into a phantom. Their tortured minds cried out to him, and Superman's sanity – already in tatters – snapped.

After the monster Atrocitus murdered Abin, Sinestro became consumed with maintaining order in his sector, no matter the cost. Eventually, his sector became a police state, with the Green Lantern symbol being seen as a symbol of fear and oppression. When Sinestro’s actions were uncovered by Hal Jordan, Sinestro was put on trial by the Guardians. During his trial, he told the Guardians they were fools to trust the power of Will to maintain order. Order could only come through fear. Found guilty, Sinestro was banished to the antimatter universe. There he met the Weaponers, who forged him a new yellow ring powered by fear. Sinestro swore to use this ring to bring order to the universe and gain revenge against the Guardians and Jordan. The powers of Sinestro’s ring are nearly identical to a Green Lantern ring, except the constructs are yellow in color. However, due to the ring being powered by fear, Sinestro has the ability to tap into and manifest the fears of his enemies.",

In Pat's belongings, she stumbled across the gear of the hero, 'The Star-Spangled Kid' and realized that Pat had once been the adult sidekick of a teenage hero. To make a mockery of Pat, she decided to wear that gear to a school dance. However, detecting someone wearing the Kid's gear, one of Kid's old enemies thought someone had taken up as the new Star-Spangled Kid and attacked the dance. Her stepfather came to Courtney's aid in a suit of mechanized battle armor he had been secretly working on and the two defeated this old foe.<br><br>Exhilarated by the battle, Courtney decided she wanted to continue on as a hero. Seeing how well she'd handled herself and how it could help them grow closer as father and daughter, Pat agreed.

Amused that he would now be her sidekick, Courtney agreed and took on the shorter heroic name, 'Stargirl.'<br><br>Courtney Whitmore is an attractive and cheerful teenage girl, adoring the life she leads as a hero.

Like her father, her tricks are not based on sleight of hand, but come from a natural ability she inherited to manipulate magic. She uses her magical abilities to solve mystical crimes and foil incursions by otherworldly forces. In addition, she is a reserve member of the Justice League and aids them in fighting magical threats.<br><br>Zatanna focuses her almost limitless magical powers by saying what she wants to accomplish backwards. For instance, if she wished a lock to open, she would say, 'Kcol Nepo!' Through not being specific enough, her spells have at times come with terrible and unforeseen consequences. Due to these consequences, Zatanna has spent years training herself to use her powers wisely and avoid unintentionally unleashing evils greater than those she combats.",
